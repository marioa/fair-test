# FAIR Test Repository

This is a target end point for FAIR and FAIR4RS metric testing software to evaluate how easy/expensive it is to get a fully compliant repository that complies with the FAIR principles. The `codemeta.json` file was generated using the [codemeta-generator](https://codemeta.github.io/codemeta-generator/).

## FAIR principles for data and research software

From [Lamprecht, Anna-Lena et al. (2020)](https://dx.doi.org/10.3233/DS-190026) modified according to [Chue Hong, N. et al (2022)](https://doi.org/10.15497/RDA00065). In general for software:

* **F: Software, and its associated metadata, is easy for both humans and machines to find.**
* **A: Software, and its metadata, is retrievable via standardized protocols.**
* **I: Software interoperates with other software by exchanging data and/or metadata, and/or through interaction via application programming interfaces (APIs), described through standards.**
* **R: Software is both usable (can be executed) and reusable (can be understood, modified, built upon, or incorporated into other software).**
